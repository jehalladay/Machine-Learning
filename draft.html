Abstract











1.    Introduction
    We need to introduce the reader to the problem, how it developed, 
    What are DDoS attacks?

    Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are cyber-attacks  to prevent access to a computer network. 
    This is accomplished by utilizing a large number of computers in 


    Why is it important to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks?
        From the perspective of consumers, corporations, and governments
        How much do attacks cost victims
        How do attacks affect service users
        How do attacks affect service operators
        How do attacks affect the people who are exploited by the attacker by having their devices hacked and used as attack vectors
        

    What motivates attackers to use this method of attack?
        Proliferation of devices that operate on the edge of networks i.e “the internet of things”
        Stock manipulation? Corporate sabotage? Etc
        Are DDoS attacks relatively easy to implement?

    What detection, mitigation, and protection techniques are used against these attacks?

3.    The Dataset Used



3.1    Types of Traffic
    Benign, DDoS attack types, etc

3.3.1    Table of Features Used and their Descriptions

Feature
Description























3.4     Preprocessing Pipeline
    Here we can elaborate on how we processed the data before it was fed into our classifier such as standardization, normalization, splits/folding, noising/denoising, test/train split sizes, etc
    How did we balance the data? This is essential because the data is less than 1% benign samples. Its not immediately apparent why this is a bad thing, but a classifier can always guess DDoS and achieve an over 99% accuracy. This is terrible. While we do not need an exact 50/50 split of data, we should experiment with different ways and ratios to split the data. This can drastically impact performance and it will also make it much easier to conduct experiments because we can perform them on a downsampled set of data. We can also use the large amount of left-over data to verify that our model performs correctly on unseen data

4.    Machine Learning Frameworks
    Did we use Keras, TensorFlow, Theano, PyTorch, SciKitLearn, etc. Did we build our own, is the code available online? We can also use different frameworks on the same experiment to evaluate their effectiveness on this task


5.    Performance Metrics Used
    What were we looking for in our results? Do we want more false positives or false negatives? Which has the worst drawbacks from the perspective of network operators or users?
    With a DDoS attack, it is reasonable to let through some attacks because it is a massively distributed attack. The goal isnt to screen out 100% of the attacks, but just a high enough percentage to allow normal operation to continue. Similarly false positives that identify benign traffic as a DDoS attack could negatively impact a user just as severely as a DDoS attack. Screening users and forcing them to take “am i human” tests can drive away web traffic and be suboptimal defense strategies

8.    Discussion




9.    Future Work
    Can our work be applied in any way that we were not able to do because of time/skill/focus limitations? Are there unique parallels that can be explored by other researchers or can our work be generalized to a larger problem domain?


10.    Conclusion

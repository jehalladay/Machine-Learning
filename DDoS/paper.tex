    This paper describes the results of applying a machine learning
    approach to the detection of DDoS attacks using a time-based
    feature set. The approach is based on the use of a time-based
    feature set that is derived from the time-based features of the
    TCP and HTTP protocols. The time-based features are derived from
    the TCP and HTTP protocols, using a large set of static and
    dynamic time-based features. The paper also describes the
    results of applying a time-based feature set to the detection of
    DDoS attacks, using a large set of static and dynamic time-based
    features. The paper also describes the results of applying a
    time-based feature set to the detection of DDoS attacks, using a
    small set of static and dynamic time-based features. The paper
    also describes the results of applying a time-based feature set
    to the detection of DDoS attacks, using a small set of static
    and dynamic time-based features.
